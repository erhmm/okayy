   <h1>STORY OF THE DAY</h1> 
   <h2>First</h2>
  <p> OKay so here's some shenanigans on what happen recently
    it was a long journey to be honest and it was such a drag but i did it anyways, because why not, everyone wants free marks you feel me.
    so it went like this. I got up one morning for class and during the class meeting, we were told to learn or complete some task on the freecodecamp website.
    And in the assisgment we were told to complete a project under html. Guess what, your boy here doesnt know nothing about what just appeared on the screen.
    I tried a few tho, and honestly, it wasnt that bad for starters. But you know the old saying goes. When there's a little too much good, there's gonna be some disaster lurking around to hit you back to reality. And guess what, your boy was a victim.
    TO BE CONTINUED</p>
